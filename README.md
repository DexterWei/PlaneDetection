# PlaneDetection
Find planes and lines from a cloud of 3D points
Results displayed as 3D plots.

The core of this plane&line detector is a RANSAC(Random sample consensus) process.

Run code on the sample point cloud stored in points.mat file for a demo. 
When run on your own data, remember to modify the parameters to fit the scale of your point cloud.
